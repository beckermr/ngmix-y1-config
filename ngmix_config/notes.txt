    - 48x48 min box size in meds files
    - similar
tb-y1a1-us82-48-002
    - coellip3 psf

y1a1-spt-004
    - riz centering psf
    - looks similar
y1a1-spt-005
    - riz centering psf
    - broad prior
    - looks similar
y1a1-spt-006
    - riz centering psf
    - tightprior
    - looks better, although still a slope vs psf
    - doing more tiles
y1a1-spt-007
    - riz centering psf
    - tightprior
    - not symmetrizing psf


try removing all bad pix images, uberseg
    - us82-005t
    - us82-002
    - us82-003 riz
collate rest of the mof run and do a new nbr subtraction run
    - us82-006t looks similar to 005t with uberseg

- better psf fitting
    - would help s/g separation
- better model fitting
    - would help everything
- old psf
    - as a check
- more bands (would just hide the problem?)
- more random realizations
    - would help everything


us82-001
    using new mof run 
        mof_version: "y1a1-us82-mof-003"
    running max like with 2 gauss psf, gauss gal

    megamix-us82-001.sh
        - currently running the 16 first tiles.

Series of tests with max like, to see what might
be related to the leakage

All had em3 PSF
001 and 005 are best
