# to try

collate rest of the mof run and do a new nbr subtraction run
    - running in us82-006t

better psf fitting
old psf
more bands (would just hide the problem?)
more random realizations


us82-001
    using new mof run 
        mof_version: "y1a1-us82-mof-003"
    running max like with 2 gauss psf, gauss gal

    megamix-us82-001.sh
        - currently running the 16 first tiles.

Series of tests with max like, to see what might
be related to the leakage

All had em3 PSF
001 and 005 are best

    like 005 but
        - rejecting outliers in the corrector code
        - using one-over-side for max frac
